This is one of the most important assignments you'll complete, as it pulls together:

* Node API server
* JWTs
* Client-side routing

!['User Dashboard Wireframe'](./img/user_dashbaord.png)

Users should only be able to access the `/users` route when authenticated by the server with a JSON web token.
