Redux creator Dan Abramov has made two excellent video series **free** on egghead.io. There's really no one better to learn it from, so spend some time going through the first series of videos before attacking the next assignments.

* [Getting Started With Redux](https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux "Redux Tutorial by Dan Abramov on egghead.io")

Make sure to have the [documentation](https://redux.js.org/ "Redux Â· A Predictable State Container for JS Apps") up on a separate screen as you work through the videos.

The second video series deals with more advanced patterns. While awesome, it's not essential that you complete it before moving on.

* [Building React Applications with Idiomatic Redux](https://egghead.io/courses/building-react-applications-with-idiomatic-redux "Building React Applications with Idiomatic Redux from @dan_abramov on @eggheadio")
